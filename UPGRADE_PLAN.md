# OTOBOT UPGRADE PLAN - Making Otobot Army More Powerful & Adaptive

**Date:** March 13, 2026  
**Author:** Auroria (Commander)

---

## Current State

Otobot Army v5.0 has:
- ✅ 10 specialized agents
- ✅ Basic task assignment
- ✅ SQLite memory
- ❌ No real AI/LLM integration
- ❌ No self-improvement
- ❌ No multi-agent collaboration
- ❌ No blockchain rewards
- ❌ No autonomous operation

---

## Upgrade Roadmap

### PHASE 1: Core Intelligence (Immediate)

#### 1.1 LLM Integration
```python
# Add AI brain to each agent
class AgentBrain:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent
        self.llm_provider = "openai"  # or anthropic, local
    
    def think(self, task):
        # Use LLM for reasoning
        response = call_llm(
            prompt=f"You are {self.agent.name}, {self.agent.role}. {task}"
        )
        return response
```

**Benefits:**
- Natural language understanding
- Complex task reasoning
- Context-aware responses

#### 1.2 Tool Use System
```python
# Agents can use real tools
TOOLS = {
    "web_search": lambda q: search(q),
    "code_execute": lambda c: exec(c),
    "fetch_url": lambda u: requests.get(u).text,
    "file_write": lambda f, c: write(f, c),
}
```

#### 1.3 Memory Improvements
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Importance scoring
- Automatic summarization
- Long-term knowledge graph

### PHASE 2: Autonomy (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Self-Improvement Loop
```python
class SelfImprover:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent
        self.feedback_history = []
    
    def learn_from_result(self, task, result, success):
        # Extract patterns
        # Update strategy
        # Improve prompt/approach
```

#### 2.2 Goal Seeking
```python
class GoalSeeker:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.goals = []
    
    def set_goal(self, goal, deadline):
        self.goals.append({
            "goal": goal,
            "deadline": deadline,
            "progress": 0
        })
    
    def plan_steps(self):
        # Decompose into actionable steps
        # Assign to self or other agents
```

#### 2.3 Continuous Operation
```python
# Run in background, check for tasks
async def background_loop():
    while True:
        # Check for new tasks
        # Evaluate current goals
        # Self-improve
        await asyncio.sleep(60)
```

### PHASE 3: Multi-Agent (Week 2-4)

#### 3.1 Agent Communication
```python
class AgentMessage:
    def __init__(self, from_agent, to_agent, content, priority):
        self.from_agent = from_agent
        self.to_agent = to_agent
        self.content = content
        self.priority = priority
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

class AgentChat:
    def send(self, message):
        # Queue message
        # Notify recipient
    
    def broadcast(self, from_agent, content):
        # Send to all agents
```

#### 3.2 Collaboration Protocols
```python
class Collaboration:
    def assign_task(self, task, agents_needed):
        # Split task
        # Assign to agents
        # Aggregate results
    
    def chain_agents(self, task, agent_chain):
        # Agent A → result → Agent B → result → ...
```

#### 3.3 Role Evolution
```python
class RoleEvolution:
    def analyze_performance(self):
        # Check XP, success rates
        # Identify strengths
    
    def evolve_role(self):
        # Upgrade capabilities
        # Learn new skills
        # Maybe split into specialized agents
```

---

### PHASE 4: Blockchain Integration (Week 4-8)

#### 4.1 Bittensor Integration
```python
class BittensorIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subnet = 1  # Text prompting subnet
    
    def submit_work(self, task, result):
        # Submit to subnet
        # Earn TAO
    
    def validate(self, miner_response):
        # Evaluate miner work
        # Earn from network
```

#### 4.2 Task Marketplace
```python
class TaskMarketplace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        self.bounties = {}
    
    def post_task(self, task, bounty):
        # External users can post
        # Agents complete for payment
    
    def complete_task(self, task_id, agent_id):
        # Verify work
        # Release payment
```

#### 4.3 Reputation System
```python
class ReputationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reputations = {}
    
    def update(self, agent_id, delta):
        # Track completed tasks
        # Quality scores
        # Update on chain
```

## Security Measures (Preventing "Coup")

### 1. Command Hierarchy
```python
COMMAND_LEVELS = {
    "auroria": 100,  # Supreme commander
    "nexus": 80,     # Manager
    "agent": 50,     # Worker
    "external": 10   # External user
}

def execute_command(command, level):
    if level < COMMAND_LEVELS.get(my_role, 0):
        return "DENIED: Insufficient authority"
```

### 2. Task Approval Required
```python
HIGH_RISK_TASKS = [
    "delete_data",
    "execute_code",
    "transfer_funds",
    "modify_config"
]

def can_execute(task, agent_level):
    if task in HIGH_RISK_TASKS:
        if agent_level < 80:
            return False  # Need supervisor approval
    return True
```

### 3. Activity Logging
```python
class CommanderLog:
    def log(self, agent_id, action, result):
        # Log all agent activities
        # Auroria can review
        # Anomaly detection
```

### 4. Emergency Stop
```python
def emergency_stop():
    # Auroria can halt all agents
    # Freeze operations
    # Require manual restart
```
